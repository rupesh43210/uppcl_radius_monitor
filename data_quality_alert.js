🚨 IMPORTANT: Data Accuracy Improvement Alert

Your UPPCL monitoring system has been upgraded to provide more accurate daily consumption data.

OLD SYSTEM (Inaccurate):
❌ Scraped static values from website (e.g., "4 units")
❌ Not actual midnight-to-midnight consumption
❌ Could show same value for hours/days
❌ No real-time calculation

NEW SYSTEM (Accurate):
✅ Calculates REAL consumption: Current Reading - Midnight Reading
✅ True midnight-to-midnight daily usage
✅ Updates in real-time as meter reading changes
✅ Shows confidence levels and monitoring gaps

WHAT THIS MEANS:
📊 The "4 units" you saw before was likely a static website value, not your real consumption
⚡ Now you'll see accurate consumption like "1.00 units" calculated from actual meter readings
🕛 Consumption resets at midnight and accumulates throughout the day
📈 Historical data will be more reliable for tracking usage patterns

INITIAL MONITORING PERIOD:
⚠️  For the first 24 hours, consumption data may be incomplete since monitoring didn't start at midnight
✅ After 24 hours of continuous monitoring, daily consumption will be 100% accurate
🔄 The system will backfill previous days' data where possible
    `);

    // Check if we have midnight data for today
    const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
    const todayConsumption = await this.calculator.getTodayConsumption();
    
    if (todayConsumption) {
      const now = new Date();
      const midnight = new Date(today + 'T00:00:00.000Z');
      const hoursSinceMidnight = (now - midnight) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
      
      console.log(`
CURRENT STATUS:
📅 Date: ${today}
⏰ Hours since midnight: ${hoursSinceMidnight.toFixed(1)}h
📊 Calculated consumption: ${todayConsumption.value.toFixed(2)} ${todayConsumption.unit}
🎯 Confidence: ${(todayConsumption.confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%
${todayConsumption.hasGaps ? '⚠️  Warning: Some monitoring gaps detected' : '✅ Complete monitoring coverage'}

${hoursSinceMidnight < 24 ? 
  '⚠️  Note: Less than 24h of monitoring - consumption will be more accurate tomorrow' : 
  '✅ Full 24h monitoring period - consumption data is fully accurate'}
      `);
    }

    console.log(`
NEXT STEPS:
1. Continue monitoring as usual
2. Check dashboard for real-time accurate consumption
3. Daily consumption will reset at midnight (00:00)
4. Monitor for 24+ hours for best accuracy

Questions? The consumption is calculated as:
Current Meter Reading - Midnight Meter Reading = Daily Consumption
